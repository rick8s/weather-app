# Weather App

## About

This application allows users to view weather for a given region by typing in a ZIP code. The page displays the current forecast and provides options for three- or seven-day forecasts for that area.

## Changes and Notes

Currently, there is no functionality present for the "Save" button, which was intended to let users save forecasts to a Firebase database as per project instructions.
